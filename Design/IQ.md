### 1. Core Microservices Concepts

**Q: How would you split a large monolith into microservices?**
A: I start by analyzing the domain and identifying bounded contexts using Domain-Driven Design principles. Each bounded context translates into a microservice focused on a specific business capability. I aim for services that follow the Single Responsibility Principle, ensuring they can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. I also consider data ownership and minimize dependencies between services to reduce coupling.

**Q: When should you NOT use microservices?**
A: Microservices add complexity and overhead, so they’re not ideal for small or simple applications that don’t require scaling or independent deployment. If the team lacks maturity in DevOps or distributed systems, or if latency and consistency are critical and hard to manage, a monolith or modular monolith might be a better choice.

### 2. Communication Between Services

**Q: How would you handle service-to-service communication?**
A: I choose communication based on use case: synchronous protocols like REST or gRPC for real-time requests requiring immediate responses, and asynchronous messaging (Kafka, RabbitMQ) for decoupling services, improving resilience, and handling high throughput or eventual consistency. I often use API gateways to centralize ingress traffic and implement backends-for-frontends for tailored client needs.

**Q: When would you use async over sync?**
A: I prefer asynchronous communication when operations can be eventual consistent, when decoupling services improves reliability, or when workflows involve long-running tasks. Asynchronous messaging prevents blocking calls, reducing cascading failures and enabling better scaling.

### 3. Design Patterns in Microservices

**Q: How would you ensure service reliability and fault tolerance?**
A: I implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures and timeouts to avoid hanging calls. I use retries with exponential backoff carefully, combined with bulkheads to isolate failures. Health checks and fallback mechanisms ensure degraded but stable behavior. Leveraging service meshes can also help with resiliency features.

**Q: How do you implement retries and timeouts without overwhelming the system?**
A: I use exponential backoff with jitter to stagger retries, preventing thundering herd problems. Timeouts are set based on SLA expectations and tuned according to the service behavior. Circuit breakers open after a threshold to stop retries when a service is unhealthy.

### 4. Testing in Microservices

**Q: How do you test microservices independently and together?**
A: Independently, I focus on unit and integration tests within each service. For integration across services, I use contract testing—especially consumer-driven contracts (like Pact)—to verify that interactions meet expectations. End-to-end tests cover full workflows. Mocks and service virtualization help isolate tests and speed up feedback.

**Q: What are the challenges of testing in a distributed system?**
A: Challenges include handling asynchronous events, data consistency, versioning APIs without breaking clients, and setting up realistic test environments that mimic production. Flaky tests due to network issues or timing also require careful handling.

### 5. Deployment & DevOps

**Q: Describe your deployment strategy for microservices.**
A: I use containerization (Docker) and orchestrate deployments with Kubernetes. CI/CD pipelines automate build, test, and deploy stages. Deployment strategies like blue/green or canary releases minimize downtime and risk. I also automate health checks and rollbacks in case of failures.

**Q: How do you manage configuration across environments?**
A: I externalize configuration using tools like Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets, environment variables, or centralized config services. I maintain separate configs per environment (dev, staging, prod) and manage secrets securely via vaults or Kubernetes secrets with strict access control.

---

### 6. Observability & Monitoring

**Q: How do you debug a failing request across services?**
A: I rely on distributed tracing (e.g., Jaeger or Zipkin) to follow requests end-to-end. Logs are centralized and structured, allowing correlation via trace IDs. Metrics alert me to anomalies, and dashboards help identify failing components or latency issues quickly.

**Q: How do you identify bottlenecks in a distributed system?**
A: Metrics on latency, throughput, and error rates are key. Tracing helps pinpoint slow services or calls. Profiling and load testing reveal resource constraints. Alerts based on SLIs/SLOs guide prioritization.

### 7. Security in Microservices

**Q: How do you secure microservice APIs?**
A: I implement authentication and authorization via OAuth2 and JWT tokens. API gateways enforce security policies, rate limiting, and request validation. Services authenticate each other, often using mutual TLS (mTLS) within a service mesh for encrypted, trusted communication.

**Q: How do you manage secret rotation and access control?**
A: I use secret management tools like HashiCorp Vault or Kubernetes Secrets with automatic rotation policies. Access is granted based on the principle of least privilege, audited regularly, and integrated into CI/CD pipelines to avoid hardcoded secrets.

### 8. Data Management in Microservices

**Q: How do you manage data consistency across services?**
A: I favor eventual consistency using patterns like Saga for distributed transactions. Services own their databases to ensure autonomy. I implement compensating transactions for rollbacks and use event-driven messaging to synchronize state changes asynchronously.

**Q: How do you handle schema changes in event-driven systems?**
A: I apply backward and forward compatibility practices, such as versioned schemas and schema registries. I design events and APIs to be extensible and additive, avoiding breaking changes. Consumers are updated to handle multiple schema versions during transitions.

### 9. Team & Architecture Leadership

**Q: How do you guide a team transitioning to microservices?**
A: I start with training on domain-driven design and microservice principles. We break down the monolith incrementally using the strangler fig pattern. I encourage defining clear service boundaries and adopting CI/CD practices early. I promote collaboration between developers and DevOps and set coding standards.

**Q: How do you ensure services stay maintainable over time?**
A: I enforce modularity and clean code principles, conduct regular code reviews, and monitor technical debt. We continuously refactor and evolve service contracts carefully. Documentation and shared ownership foster maintainability.

### 10. Common Pitfalls & Tradeoffs

**Q: What are the biggest challenges you’ve faced with microservices?**
A: Managing distributed transactions and eventual consistency is complex. Operational overhead increases with many services—monitoring, logging, and debugging get harder. Avoiding service sprawl and ensuring teams don’t duplicate functionality requires strong governance.

**Q: If you had to do it again, what would you change?**
A: I’d invest earlier in observability and automated testing to catch issues sooner. I’d start with fewer, well-defined services to reduce complexity, and invest more in cross-team communication and documentation upfront.
