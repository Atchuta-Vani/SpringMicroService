Great question ‚Äî and crucial for interview prep! As a **Lead Software Engineer** in charge of **microservice architecture**, you're expected to **design, build, and guide teams** on scalable, maintainable, and secure systems. Interviewers will look for both your **technical depth** and **architectural judgment**.

Here‚Äôs a comprehensive checklist of **what you should know** ‚Äî broken down into areas you‚Äôll likely be asked about:

---

## üîß 1. **Core Microservices Concepts**

### ‚úÖ Understand:

* What microservices are and why they‚Äôre used (vs monoliths)
* Bounded contexts and Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
* The **"Single Responsibility Principle"** at the service level
* Service independence: deploy, scale, and fail independently
* How to design **loose coupling and strong cohesion**

üéØ *Expect to answer:*

> ‚ÄúHow would you split a large monolith into microservices?‚Äù
> ‚ÄúWhen should you **not** use microservices?‚Äù

---

## üåê 2. **Communication Between Services**

### ‚úÖ Know the differences:

* **Synchronous** (REST, gRPC) vs **Asynchronous** (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
* Event-driven architecture (EDA)
* API gateway patterns and backends for frontends (BFF)

üéØ *Expect to answer:*

> ‚ÄúHow would you handle service-to-service communication?‚Äù
> ‚ÄúWhen would you use async over sync?‚Äù

---

## üß± 3. **Design Patterns in Microservices**

### Know these patterns well:

* API Gateway
* Circuit Breaker (Resilience4j, Hystrix)
* Service Registry & Discovery (e.g., Consul, Eureka, or Kubernetes DNS)
* Sidecar pattern (for service mesh)
* Strangler Fig pattern (for refactoring monoliths)

üéØ *Expect to be asked:*

> ‚ÄúHow would you ensure service reliability and fault tolerance?‚Äù
> ‚ÄúHow do you implement retries and timeouts without overwhelming the system?‚Äù

---

## üß™ 4. **Testing in Microservices**

### Be clear on:

* Unit testing vs Integration vs Contract testing
* Consumer-Driven Contracts (CDC) ‚Äì e.g., using **Pact**
* Test strategies for APIs, async events, and schema evolution

üéØ *Expect:*

> ‚ÄúHow do you test microservices independently and together?‚Äù
> ‚ÄúWhat are the challenges of testing in a distributed system?‚Äù

---

## üöÄ 5. **Deployment & DevOps**

### You should be familiar with:

* Containerization (Docker)
* Kubernetes fundamentals (pods, deployments, services, configmaps, probes)
* CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI)
* Blue/Green and Canary deployments

üéØ *Expect:*

> ‚ÄúDescribe your deployment strategy for microservices.‚Äù
> ‚ÄúHow do you manage configuration across environments?‚Äù

---

## üß≠ 6. **Observability & Monitoring**

### Know the key pillars:

* **Logging** (structured logs, centralized logging with ELK or Loki)
* **Metrics** (Prometheus, Grafana)
* **Tracing** (Jaeger, Zipkin, OpenTelemetry)

üéØ *Expect:*

> ‚ÄúHow do you debug a failing request across services?‚Äù
> ‚ÄúHow do you identify bottlenecks in a distributed system?‚Äù

---

## üîê 7. **Security in Microservices**

### You should know:

* Authentication and Authorization (OAuth2, JWT)
* Securing inter-service communication (mTLS, service mesh)
* Secrets management (Vault, K8s secrets)
* Zero trust principles

üéØ *Expect:*

> ‚ÄúHow do you secure microservice APIs?‚Äù
> ‚ÄúHow do you manage secret rotation and access control?‚Äù

---

## üóÉÔ∏è 8. **Data Management in Microservices**

### Key concepts:

* **Database per service** principle
* Managing distributed transactions (Saga pattern, eventual consistency)
* Event sourcing vs CRUD
* Schema versioning and compatibility

üéØ *Expect:*

> ‚ÄúHow do you manage data consistency across services?‚Äù
> ‚ÄúHow do you handle schema changes in event-driven systems?‚Äù

---

## üß† 9. **Team & Architecture Leadership**

### Your leadership skills matter:

* Designing architecture diagrams and technical specs
* Leading code reviews and setting standards
* Managing technical debt in a microservices world
* Coaching teams on good service boundaries and reuse
* Making build-vs-buy decisions

üéØ *Expect:*

> ‚ÄúHow do you guide a team transitioning to microservices?‚Äù
> ‚ÄúHow do you ensure services stay maintainable over time?‚Äù

---

## üìú 10. **Common Pitfalls & Tradeoffs**

You should be able to speak about:

* Overhead of microservices
* Service sprawl and operational complexity
* Network latency and eventual consistency
* Monitoring and debugging challenges
* Balancing autonomy with governance

üéØ *Expect:*

> ‚ÄúWhat are the biggest challenges you‚Äôve faced with microservices?‚Äù
> ‚ÄúIf you had to do it again, what would you change?‚Äù

---
