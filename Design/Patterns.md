 **key microservices design patterns**



## ðŸ”‘ Essential Microservices Patterns to Know

### 1. **API Gateway Pattern**

* Acts as a single entry point for all clients
* Handles request routing, authentication, rate limiting, and protocol translation
* Simplifies client communication with multiple backend services

### 2. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**

* Prevents cascading failures when a service is down or slow
* Detects failures and temporarily stops calls to the failing service
* Enables graceful degradation and fallback mechanisms

### 3. **Service Discovery Pattern**

* Allows services to find each other dynamically (e.g., Consul, Eureka, or Kubernetes DNS)
* Supports scaling and deployment changes without manual config updates

### 4. **Sidecar Pattern**

* Runs helper components (like logging, monitoring, or proxy) alongside the main service
* Often used in service mesh architectures (e.g., Istio)

### 5. **Strangler Fig Pattern**

* Incrementally refactors or replaces a monolith by gradually replacing parts with microservices
* Minimizes risk during migration

### 6. **Saga Pattern**

* Manages distributed transactions using a series of local transactions with compensations
* Supports eventual consistency across services

### 7. **Bulkhead Pattern**

* Isolates failures by partitioning services or resources to prevent fault propagation
* Improves overall system resilience

### 8. **Backends for Frontends (BFF)**

* Creates separate APIs tailored for different clients (web, mobile, IoT)
* Helps optimize user experience and decouple client-specific logic

### 9. **Event Sourcing and CQRS**

* Event Sourcing stores state changes as a sequence of events
* CQRS separates read and write models for better scalability and flexibility

### 10. **Retry Pattern**

* Automatically retries failed requests with exponential backoff
* Used carefully to avoid overwhelming services
